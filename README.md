# Project Name
The briefest description of my cool project and why you should all use it.

## :computer: [Click here](https://jaygriggsau.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) to see my live project!

## Algo
For our Tic-Tac-Toe JavaScript game, we'll only need three files. 

In index.html, we'll assign classes to all the different parts of the game. In style.css, we'll take care of the game's styling. And in script.js, we'll write the actual code for the game.

I know what I want to do.

Create a 3x3 grid using sections

When a player clicks a section it draws an X or O depending on the players turn.

It adds that posistion to an array for each player turn. posistions are 0-8 
Example [6,7,0]

It should check the current players array to see if its a winning array combonation.

IF a player gets a winning array combo it should display that they won. 

if they lose it should say they lose

if its a draw it should say its a draw.
