# Project Name
The briefest description of my cool project and why you should all use it.

## :computer: [Click here](#) to see my live project!

## Algo
For our Tic-Tac-Toe JavaScript game, we'll only need three files. 

In index.html, we'll assign classes to all the different parts of the game. In style.css, we'll take care of the game's styling. And in script.js, we'll write the actual code for the game.

The game will start with the x character, so that makes x the first player. 

Create HTML Boilerplate

add 9 sections to create the board and give them a class

add other UI like player turn, winning/losing/draw message

Create the game logic

create a varible to hold x and o 

create an array that will store winnng combonations

use this to check if game has been won or not by checking against current game play

Display win/lose/draw
