# Project Name
A simple tic tac toe game that allows two players too play with each other and keeps score.

## Algo
For our Tic-Tac-Toe JavaScript game, we'll only need three files. 

In index.html, we'll assign classes to all the different parts of the game. In style.css, we'll take care of the game's styling. And in script.js, we'll write the actual code for the game.

I know what I want to do.

Create a 3x3 grid using sections

When a player clicks a section it draws an X or O depending on the players turn.

It adds that posistion to an array for each player turn. posistions are 0-8 
Example [6,7,0]

It should check the current players array to see if its a winning array combonation.

IF a player gets a winning array combo it should display that they won. 

if they lose it should say they lose

if its a draw it should say its a draw.


## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- I found my original problem solving algo was no where detailed enough.
- I had to use pen and paper to break down my problems bit by bit
- Commenting each line helped me to sort out my game logic
- I would write the problem down, then break it into smaller steps
- Then it felt like a small win each time I completed it.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- Nothing I can find.... yet

## :sob: Lessons learnt
- I over complicated it to start with and started to write complicated functions.
- Had to stop and follow Kasuns advice on keeping it simple and get the code workoing BEFORE building the functions.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- Clean up code base
- There is code that could be wrapped in functions for ease of use.
